Hubspot,"While the factors of CRM pricing can be complex, the good news is that the barriers to adopting CRM are lower than they ever have been before. A big part of the reason we made HubSpot CRM 100% free was so that people wouldn’t have to “take the plunge” on a long-term agreement with per-license fees, just in order to find out if you need a CRM. Keep your whole team using what they’re used to, and move a couple of reps.

At HubSpot, the future of CRM is something we think about a lot. Over the years, we’ve seen and heard from our customers, many of whom face the same challenges with their CRM systems:

Most CRM systems are complicated, and using them properly requires a lot of manual work on the sales team (who usually don’t see equal value in return).
Most CRM systems are empty databases that don’t have any insight into what customers are up to on your website, on social media, and in the many different places places and ways that customers interact with your company today.
With these realities in mind, in 2014 HubSpot launched HubSpot CRM. Designed to work seamlessly with the HubSpot marketing product, we went a step further to make it 100% free for anyone to try and use. No user limits, no storage limits, no time limits.

CRM systems like HubSpot CRM solve the many challenges presented by growth. CRMs effectively organize contact, company, and sales opportunity information, as well as every interaction that takes place through the multitude of customer communication channels, including your website, email, phone calls, social media, and other channels. It’s more critical than ever for marketing and sales teams to function as a cohesive unit, and CRM systems are the perfect solution to help scaling organizations achieve that goal.",,,CRM,

SAP Customer Profitability Analytics,"You can use this business process to calculate customer profitability, which is one of the most frequently used methods for customer valuation. Customer profitability is most easily calculated as the difference between revenue and costs.

The data captured in CO-PA can be transferred into SAP NetWeaver BI for analysis. Similarly, you can also transfer data from SAP NetWeaver BI into CO-PA. In this way, you can use activities entered in SAP CRM to allocate sales and marketing costs to the individual customers that caused them in CO-PA.System posts incoming sales orders in profitability analysis (SAP ECC)This provides an early estimate of the anticipated revenues before the sales order has been completed.System posts billing documents and values (SAP ECC) When a sales order has been completed, SAP ECC posts billing documents and actual revenues in Controlling and in Financial Accounting.System performs derivation and valuation in profitability analysis (SAP ECC)When the incoming sales orders and billing documents are posted to profitability analysis, the system performs characteristic derivation and valuation, thereby complementing the document data.  System updates data in customer knowledge base System calculates (customer) profitability (SAP ECC)This is done using a detailed customer contribution margin scheme to compare in Profitability Analysis the revenue made with a customer against the sales deductions and the costs incurred (such as production and sales costs).System updates data in customer knowledge base (SAP NetWeaver BI)By regularly extracting data from SAP ECC into SAP NetWeaver BI, the system updates the profitability data in SAP NetWeaver BI.",,,Performance Management,N/A

Oracle Data Integrator,"A widely used data integration software product, Oracle Data Integrator provides a new declarative design approach to defining data transformation and integration processes, resulting in faster and simpler development and maintenance. Based on a unique E-LT architecture (Extract - Load Transform), Oracle Data Integrator not only guarantees the highest level of performance possible for the execution of data transformation and validation processes but is also the most cost-effective solution available today.

Oracle Data Integrator provides a unified infrastructure to streamline data and application integration projects. Faster and simpler development and maintenance: The declarative rules driven approach to data integration greatly reduces the learning curve of the product and increases developer productivity while facilitating ongoing maintenance. This approach separates the definition of the processes from their actual implementation, and separates the declarative rules (the ""what"") from the data flows (the ""how"").

Data quality firewall: Oracle Data Integrator ensures that faulty data is automatically detected and recycled before insertion in the target application. This is performed without the need for programming, following the data integrity rules and constraints defined both on the target application and in Oracle Data Integrator.

Better execution performance: traditional data integration software (ETL) is based on proprietary engines that perform data transformations row by row, thus limiting performance. By implementing an E-LT architecture, based on your existing RDBMS engines and SQL, you are capable of executing data transformations on the target server at a set-based level, giving you much higher performance.

Simpler and more efficient architecture: the E-LT architecture removes the need for an ETL Server sitting between the sources and the target server. It utilizes the source and target servers to perform complex transformations, most of which happen in batch mode when the server is not busy processing end-user queries.

Platform Independence: Oracle Data Integrator supports all platforms, hardware and OSs with the same software.

Data Connectivity: Oracle Data Integrator supports all RDBMSs including all leading Data Warehousing platforms such as Oracle, Exadata, Teradata, IBM DB2, Netezza, Sybase IQ and numerous other technologies such as flat files, ERPs, LDAP, XML.

Cost-savings: the elimination of the ETL Server and ETL engine reduces both the initial hardware and software acquisition and maintenance costs. The reduced learning curve and increased developer productivity significantly reduce the overall labor costs of the project, as well as the cost of ongoing enhancements.",,,ETL,N/A
